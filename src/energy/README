PMT: Power Measurement Toolkit
paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03724
The PMT library is available at the link: https://git.astron.nl/RD/pmt

The software in this folder is conceived to be a wrapper for the
C++ PMT library. It should be smootly used in any C and CUDA-C code.

How to use the library:
   - include the header file "energy_pmt.h" in your source code;
   - compile "energy_pmt_methods.cpp" with any C++ compliant compiler
     (see below the macros definition);
   - link the final executable with any C++ compliant compiler.
   
Macros definition:
   - _ENERGY_PMT_ to use the library;
	- _ENERGY_RAPL_   to collect power measurements from CPU using RAPL;
	- _ENERGY_NVIDIA_ to collect power measurements from NVIDIA GPUs;
	- _ENERGY_AMD_    to collect power measurements from AMD GPUs.
