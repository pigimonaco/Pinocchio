[Mon May 13 2024 20:25:59] This is pinocchio V5.0, running on 1 MPI tasks

This version uses 3LPT displacements
Radiation is not included in the Friedmann equations
Ellipsoidal collapse will be computed as Monaco (1995)
This version of the code works with scale-dependent growing modes
Scales will range from      0.001 to    31.6228 1/Mpc, in 10 steps
Scale-dependent growth rates will be worked out from CAMB P(k) files
The power spectrum will include TOTAL matter fluctuations, including neutrinos (if present)
Initial conditions will be generated with non-random modules of the Fourier modes
