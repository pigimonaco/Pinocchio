[Sun Apr  7 2024 21:32:45] This is pinocchio V5.0, running on 1 MPI tasks

This version uses 3LPT displacements
Radiation is not included in the Friedmann equations
Ellipsoidal collapse will be computed as Monaco (1995)
This version of the code works with scale-dependent growing modes
Initial conditions will be generated with non-random modules of the Fourier modes
